# Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning Java, including code examples, explanations, and notes on various Java topics. My goal is to explore and understand Java in depth, building a solid foundation by working through code samples and practical exercises.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders representing different Java topics. Each folder contains relevant code files, notes, and examples to illustrate key concepts. As I progress through Java, I'll keep adding new topics and updating code as needed.

## Topics Covered

Below are some of the core topics I plan to cover as I learn Java. This list will expand as I dive into new areas.

1. **Basics of Java**
   - Hello World program
   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - Input/Output operations
   - Control structures (if-else, loops, switch statements)

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
   - Constructors and method overloading
   - Access modifiers

3. **Java Collections Framework**
   - Lists, Sets, and Maps
   - Iterators and streams
   - Generics in collections

4. **Exception Handling**
   - Types of exceptions
   - try-catch blocks, finally, throw, and throws
   - Custom exceptions

5. **File Handling**
   - Reading and writing files
   - Serialization and deserialization

6. **Multithreading and Concurrency**
   - Creating threads and runnable tasks
   - Thread synchronization and inter-thread communication
   - Concurrency utilities

7. **Java 8 Features**
   - Lambda expressions
   - Functional interfaces
   - Streams and filters
   - Method references

8. **Java Networking**
   - Sockets and client-server communication
   - URL and HTTP connections

9. **Advanced Java**
   - Reflection API
   - Annotations
   - Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
   - JavaFX basics for GUI applications

## Running the Code

To run the code examples, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can run the Java files by navigating to the folder with the specific code example and using the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the Java file
javac FileName.java

# Run the compiled class file
java FileName
